# Thorax

- *Current weight* 36kb gzipped
  - Using Zepto
  - Swapping Handlebars for runtime during build
  - Would CommonJS modules make it smaller?
- Even less boilerplate than Marionette
- Less primitives than Marionette, but more explicit in decision making around how components should be used
- `{{#link }}` is super handy, but breaks right/meta clicks.
  - I should fix this, if I have the time
- Entire system feels very cohesive and tight.

## Server Side Generation

Right now I can only really go so far as to scrape DOM hooks generated by `{{#link}}`. There appears to be some work over at Walmart Labs, but nothing has been open sourced.

# React

- Concept seems very promising
- Out of box server-side rendering is exceptionally attractive
- Situations awareness of DOM state on boot seems unique
- JSX could be difficult for some to accept
