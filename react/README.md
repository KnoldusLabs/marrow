## React

- I'm hitting a pretty steep curve with this one. There seems to be really good thinking behind this, I'm just not quite there yet.
- Concept seems very promising
- Out of box server-side rendering is exceptionally attractive
- Situations awareness of DOM state on boot seems unique
- JSX could be difficult for some to accept. It feels alien at first and as some syntax requirements.
