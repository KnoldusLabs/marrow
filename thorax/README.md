## [ThoraxJS](http://thoraxjs.org/)

**Bottom line:** Thorax is awesome. It feels productive and light weight, however I still don't have a clear answer on server-side html generation.

### 1. Development speed

Documentation clearly spells out the API, but when I started the greater picture was pretty blurry. Having said that, the handlebars helpers are _fantastic_, and provide much needed assistance when working with templates. The [yeoman generator](https://github.com/walmartlabs/generator-thorax) helps a lot with this, however I found myself searching in vain for a good example to latch on to. I will say that **with good yeomon based sub-generators, I feel like I saved a ton of time thinking about project structure**.

Thorax supports advanced `Backbone.View` classes like `Backbone.Marionette`, however it doesn't make a distinction for Modules or Controllers. With that in mind, the approach it takes feels more modern than Marionette. I felt like there was even _less_ boilerplate than Marionette, which was the biggest reason why latched on to that framework.

Additionally, Thorax:

- Clearly makes the decision that routers are controllers, it felt nice to have this decision out of the way.
  - It looks like this may be different with a `lumbar.js` based approach?
- Automatically fetch model/collection on render
- Loading states and rendering states are handlebars helpers. This makes it easy to manage preloading and other "not ready" states.
- Provides easy access to data through jQuery/Zepto plugins
- Has a really killer Chrome extension
- `{{#link }}` is super handy, but breaks right/meta clicks. Still, out of the box pushState is fantastic.

This is an awesome framework. Walmart Labs really put a lot of thought into this. I'll have to hold final judgment until I build something larger with it, but as it stands now I think that I prefer it over Backbone.Marionette.

I got started with these resources:

- [A Blog With Thorax](http://thinkingonthinking.com/A-Blog-With-Thorax/]). This actually ended up being the foundation for this project, and the goal for all other projects in this repo. This post is interesting in that it produces a fake API with jquery-mockjax.
- [Fundamental Screencast](http://vimeo.com/60230630). This does a decent job of covering basics, but like anything basic and under 10 minutes, there's not much to sync teeth into.

### 2. Bulk

`113kb (36kb gzipped)`

Nice! Thorax was designed for Walmart's mobile site, and works flawlessly with Zepto. I was also able to squeeze out quite a bit of savings replacing `Handlebars` with `handlebars-runtime` during the r.js optimization. I wonder if CommonJS handlebars templates would be smaller.

In general, I never felt worried once about weight or speed, Thorax is super fast.

### 3. Flexibility

Rigidness never crossed my mind developing the app. Thorax is easy to modify and has a great core set of features. The one concern I have is that it has many backward breaking modifications to Backbone core. I could see this making the later application of this framework on top of Backbone difficult, whereas Marionette does this seamlessly. I'm not really sure you would ever chose to go this route if going with Thorax, but it should be an important consideration.

### 4.Server Side Generation

Right now I can only really go so far as to scrape DOM hooks generated by `{{#link}}`. There appears to be some work over at Walmart Labs, but nothing has been open sourced. I need to look into this.

### TODO

- Better server-side rendering is probably possible. More time should be spent here.
- Explore client-side storage. The [localforage](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage) driver for Backbone is super cool, but doesn't fallback to standard sync if the data doesn't exist yet. Consider implementing a work around.
